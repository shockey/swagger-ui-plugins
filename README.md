## Contributing

Feel free to open issues and pull requests that fix bugs, add functionality, and introduce new plugins.

I will make releases of each plugin when/if your PR is accepted.

Please add yourself to the Contributors list below if you add a new plugin!

You can use the `npm run new-plugin` command to easily generate a new plugin skeleton from boilerplate. This should give you at least a reasonable head start on your plugin in a way that is generally compatible with the conventions in this library.

**One easy way to contribute is to copy over plugins found at https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/5027#issuecomment-438745785.**

## Versioning

Each plugin uses [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. 

A plugin's version is unrelated to its Swagger UI compatibility: compatible versions are indicated by the plugin's Swagger UI `peerDependency`.
